a full stack travel website for hotel booking. 
I have seen many travel websites, but i didnt like the interface and complexity of those websites, so i though of creating one on my own, to provide a simple interface which should be understandable to everyone, i.e the interface should be straight forward, non cluttered and should provide a simple booking process.
colour shade is inspired from Air Bnb, but its not air bnb :)
Login flow, authentication, integration of cloud and AI chat assistant(both audio and chat) are the modules yet to be completed. Error handling, directory structure, UI, mongodb integration etc are already done. 
feel free to riase PR's :)
